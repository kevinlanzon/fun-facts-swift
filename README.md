Fun Facts in Swift
-----------

The Fun Facts app displays a random fact when the 'Show another fun fact' button is pressed and the background colour changes when a new fun fact is displayed.

The Fun Facts app teaches how to use the Swift language and the Xcode and Interface Builder tools. I learnt about core concepts such as views and view controllers, creating a data model and the Model-View-Controller design pattern.

Currently there are 10 fun facts hardcoded into an array and the app is untested as this was just a learning exercise on how to set up a Swift project and learn how to use Xcode.
